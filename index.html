                    <div class="about-paragraphs">
                        <p>My name is Akiva Yeshurun, and I am a full-time CS student at Florida International University as well as a full stack engineer. I have always been captivated by the convergence of the world of technology and the world of people. This fascination led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science with minors in Psychology and Digital Art, where I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and Javascript, design skills such as UX research, ideation, and prototyping, and have learnt about social psychology and personality development. Through my coursework and personal projects, I have honed my problem-solving skills and gained hands-on experience in software development, especially focusing on building software to make education accessible.</p>

                        <p>What excites me about Software Engineering is the chance to work on projects that span so many different intersecting levels. My passion lies in creating systems that have optimal functionality in every dimension; human and machine, software and hardware, engineer and end users, across time and space. This interest is compounded by the fact that technology can impact every sphere of knowledge and every industry. This creative outlook excites me because it focuses on a key point of software design that I find highly important: perspective. Perspective of the customer, perspective of the product management team, perspective of the internal engineering/architecture of the product, only through this an effective and people-oriented tool can be built.</p>
                        
                        <p>Due to my professional experience as well as my focus on education, I bring a unique perspective and valuable skills to the table. Prior to my years in the professional workforce I spent two years abroad performing Talmudic research, in which I have over a decade of experience. This experience has provided me with deep analytical thinking, problem-solving, and research skills, which I believe are transferable to various professional settings. In my academic years I honed skills ranging from Computational Geometry to Artificial Intelligence, and have experience in Java, C, Python, and Javascript. I am familiar with Operating Systems and Cloud Computing, and using them in real world environments.</p>
                        
                        <p>As I continue my academic and professional journey, I am eager to apply my interdisciplinary knowledge and skills to real-world projects and challenges. I am committed to continuous learning and growth in both my technical abilities and understanding of human behavior, aiming to make meaningful contributions in the field of technology and beyond.</p>
